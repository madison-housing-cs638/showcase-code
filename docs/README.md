# CS638: Data Science in Madison: Property Values in Madison

### Aarushi Gupta, Ben Kizaric Desmond Fung 

For this project, we will look to examine trends in property values (speciffically Tax Assessed & past home sale prices) here in Madison.

As of now, we have a couple of primary things we want to investigate:

## Racialized names and Property Values 
See initial pitch [here](./media/Home_Assessment_Pitch.pdf)

## Proximity to public goods
We want to investigate the relationship between home values and some public goods, such as:
* Bike Paths
* Libraries & Schools
* Parks and Water
