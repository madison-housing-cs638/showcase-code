For this week, we improved one of our existing plots based on feedback. We plotted which houses in different assessment areas were valued more than the sales price and which were less. The goal was to study if this is difference is more in areas having higher black population, however, no such trend was seen. To study what other factors can be responsible for this we plotted population and number of homes in each assessment area on the basemap as well.

None of this could explain the bunch of red dots which can be see around the middle.
