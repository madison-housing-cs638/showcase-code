This week we want to investigate whether having a racialized black name has an impact on Tax Assessment Value in Madison.
We explored 75581 addresses in madison and filtered out all the buyers' names that contained any of the 80 racialized black names. Afterward, we split them into two groups, group that contains racialized name and group that doesn't contain racialized names.
The barplot compares total tax assessment value in thousand between racialized and non-racialized group.
Surprisingly, no significant difference was observed from the barplot(racialized mean \\$297556 v.s. not racialized mean \\$298463). It seems like having a racialized name doesn't cause any significant difference on the buyers' side.
Therefore, we conclude that racialized black name is not a factor in buyers' single-family tax assessment value.

The x-axis represents the number of Africa-American/Black people present in different localities in Madison (Grouped by Zip Codes). The y-axis represents the Average Real Estate Sale Price in different localities. We tried to plot  the sale price with respect to number of black people living in that area. We can see a linear trend that as the number of black people in a locality increases the avg sale price goes down. However, this relation is not very strong.

In future, we plan to assess what other factors contribute to deciding the sale price of real-estate in a particular area.
