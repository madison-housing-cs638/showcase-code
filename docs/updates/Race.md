The x-axis represents the number of Africa-American/Black people present in different localities in Madison (Grouped by Zip Codes). The y-axis represents the Average Real Estate Sale Price in different localities. We tried to plot  the sale price with respect to number of black people living in that area. We can see a linear trend that as the number of black people in a locality increases the avg sale price goes down. However, this relation is not very strong.

In future, we plan to assess what other factors contribute to deciding the sale price of real-estate in a particular area.
