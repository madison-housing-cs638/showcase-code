## Use in other apps

As a github package, developers need to sign in and setup an environmental variable in order to import this package from github.  


1. Generate a github personal access token [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) 
   
   Make sure to write this down! 
2. Set an environmental varible for this token.
   Edit your .bashrc file by running `code .` from the `~` directory, then open the `.bashrc` file.

   Add `export NPM_PASS=<token>` to the end of the file, save, and exit code.
